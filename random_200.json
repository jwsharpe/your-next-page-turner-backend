It soon emerges that Mr. Gibson's marriage had been unhappy- he treated his wife very badly. He had fallen in love with her when he met her in Brazil, but soon realised they had nothing in common. He became attracted to Miss Dunbar; since he could not marry her, he had attempted to please her in other ways- by trying to help people less fortunate than himself. Maria Gibson was found lying in a pool of blood on Thor Bridge with a bullet through the head and note from the governess, agreeing to a meeting at that location, in her hand. A recently discharged revolver with one shot fired is found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe. Holmes agrees to look at the situation in spite of the damning evidence.   From the outset, Holmes observes some rather odd things about the case. How could Miss Dunbar so coolly and rationally have planned and carried out the murder and then carelessly tossed the murder weapon into her wardrobe? What was the strange chip on the underside of the bridge's stone balustrade? Why was Mrs. Gibson clutching the note from Miss Dunbar when she died?

His critical discussions of liberal democratic ideals and institutions continue to arouse controversy, but even his opponents concede his uncanny sense for the basic problems of modern politics. Political Romanticism is a historical study that, like all of Schmitt's major works, offers a fundamental political critique. In it, he defends a concept of political action based on notions of good and evil, justice and injustice, and attacks the political passivity entailed by the romanticization of experience. The book has three strands. The first is an attack on received notions of the origins of the Romantic Movement. Schmitt argues that this movement represents a secularization, subjectification, and privatization in which God is replaced by the emancipated, private individual of the bourgeois social order. The second is an assault on political romanticism that includes a broader attack on the new European bourgeoisie, which Schmitt characterizes as the historical bearer of the movement. The third strand is a defense of political conservatism and a refutation of the view that political romanticism is intrinsically linked with romanticism. Here Schmitt argues that the political romantic is tied not to positions but to aesthetics, and can therefore as easily become a Danton as a Frederick the Great. Guy Oakes's introduction places the book in historical context and also suggests its continuing relevance through his discussion of the latest outcropping of political romanticism in the late 1960s, intriguingly brought out in his example of Norman Mailer as a political romantic. Political Romanticism is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought, edited by Thomas McCarthy.","format":"paperback","genre":"Philosophy, Politics, Philosophy, Theory","id":279247,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1173376601l\/279247.jpg","isbn":"9780262691420.0","key_words":"view schmitt argues god liberal democratic ideals parliamentary democracy mit press concept new european bourgeoisie critical discussions received notions three strands continuing relevance romanticism emancipated private individual broader attack example movement represents basic problems secularization subjectification frederick discussion intriguingly brought political passivity entailed carl defends books easily become uncanny sense english replaced origins romantic legal theorists modern politics characterizes positions even arouse controversy crisis latest outcropping experience second series studies historical study conservatism theology late intrinsically linked bearer twentieth century danton includes like institutions continue bourgeois social order evil justice also suggests therefore schmitts major works offers first published refutation fundamental critique defense action based good aesthetics included book romanticization one injustice norman mailer opponents concede third strand great guy oakess introduction places leading author attacks privatization context thomas mccarthy tied contemporary german thought edited assault","num_ratings":"54","pages":220.0,"ratings":"4.13","titles":"Political Romanticism"},{"au_ge":"edgarwallace humor classics historical historicalfiction mystery","authors":"Edgar Wallace","bag_of_words":"edgarwallace humor classics historical historicalfiction mystery mustread ebook features argues cases involving murder forgery save author arthur train \u2019 new york district attorney tutt hepplewhite tramp delightful collection brings kindliest lawyer tackles hometown mock hen genial wit fans like arcane legal point introduction devices corrupt turtle rare happy offices america impossible \u2014 ensure accuracy prosecution downtrodden lallapaloosa limited wins ephraim esq never met chagrin wisest bear mysteries pottsville sharp mind theft always finding manhattan hard luck story defending mr forego professionally proofread readability many others based otto penzler series powerful fee specializes day much experiences working","desc_clean":"America\u2019s wisest and kindliest lawyer tackles a series of impossible cases\u2014and wins  Ephraim Tutt Esq never met a hard luck story he didn\u2019t like The rare lawyer happy to forego his fee Tutt specializes in defending the downtrodden against the powerful and the corrupt In Manhattan and his hometown of Pottsville New York he argues cases involving murder forgery and theft always finding some arcane legal point to save the day\u2014much to the chagrin of the prosecution In this delightful collection Tutt brings his sharp mind and genial wit to bear on the cases of the Mock Hen and Mock Turtle the Hepplewhite Tramp the Lallapaloosa Limited and many others   Based on author Arthur Train\u2019s experiences working in the offices of the New York District Attorney Tutt and Mr Tutt is a mustread for fans of legal mysteries   This ebook features a new introduction by Otto Penzler and has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices","description":"America\u2019s wisest and kindliest lawyer tackles a series of impossible cases\u2014and wins  Ephraim Tutt, Esq., never met a hard luck story he didn\u2019t like.

Hero John Carter proves himself against deadly foes in The Martian Trilogy. In the first installment, Carter wins the affections of the \"princess of Mars\" and the respect of the Martian warlords whom he befriends. The excitement continues in The Gods of Mars when Carter engages the Black Pirates in airborne combat above the dead seas of Mars and leads a revolt to free the Martian races from a religion that thrives on living sacrifices. In the third book, Warlord of Mars, Carter overcomes the forces of evil that would destroy the planet. By the end of the trilogy the Martians all clamor for a triumphant John Carter to be their king.  About the Author: Born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 1, 1875, Edgar Rice Burroughs grew to maturity during the height of the Industrial Revolution and witnessed the emergence of the United States as a twentieth-century world power. Hailing from a well-to-do family, Burroughs was given an aristocratic education steeped in Latin and Greek, but he was drawn more to an itinerant life of adventure than to a life in the boardroom. The author of Tarzan of the Apes (1912), Burroughs did not confine himself to a single genre; he also wrote medieval romances (The Outlaw of Torn, 1914), westerns (The War Chief of the Apaches, 1927), and mainstream novels (The Girl from Hollywood, 1922).","format":"paperback","genre":"Science Fiction, Fantasy, Fiction, Classics","id":668851,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1388884655l\/668851.jpg","isbn":"9780760755853.0","key_words":"mainstream novels martians excitement continues mars carter overcomes cliffhanging tension befriends tarzan princess martian warlords early twentieth century life burroughs novel latin triumphant john first installment wins elements religion forces war chief hollywood dead seas leads thrives adventure respect emergence king rains imaginative fantasy september edgar rice grew single genre free affections confine engages planet deadly foes itinerant girl author born height also wrote medieval romances outlaw tales trilogy helped define new literary emerging races third book warlord apes torn westerns witnessed revolt would become known chicago illinois apaches airborne combat twentiethcentury world power hailing industrial revolution evil end boardroom black pirates gods classical myth fastpaced plots united states greek aristocratic education steeped given reader gets wet sciencefiction writer jack mcdevitt combining otherworldly adventures science fiction hero proves maturity welltodo family drawn living sacrifices vivid prose clamor destroy","num_ratings":"2405","pages":617.0,"ratings":"4.01","titles":"The Martian Tales Trilogy (Barsoom #1-3)"},{"au_ge":"jackboyle foodanddrink cookbooks foodanddrink cooking foodanddrink food nonfiction","authors":"Jack Boyle","bag_of_words":"jackboyle foodanddrink cookbooks foodanddrink cooking foodanddrink food nonfiction ","desc_clean":null,"description":null,"format":null,"genre":"Food and Drink, Cookbooks, Food and Drink, Cooking, Food and Drink, Food, Nonfiction","id":11013513,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1386262144l\/11013513.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"","num_ratings":"199","pages":null,"ratings":"3.30","titles":"The Italian Cook Book: The Art of Eating Well"},{"au_ge":"josephroth fiction europeanliterature germanliterature classics shortstories literature jewish literature cultural ukraine novella","authors":"Joseph Roth","bag_of_words":"josephroth fiction europeanliterature germanliterature classics shortstories literature jewish literature cultural ukraine novella return customers dwindle life takes upon leviathan watches progrody \u2019 respected coral merchant befriending evil twist final decider one sea new fantasizes tour moved living learning quickly becoming devil sought sailor nephew small town offers nissen come region deep russian interior piczenik makes residents comes visit loses little time reefs never three weeks business purpose finds outside fate may stays onceinalifetime opportunity neighboring odessa peak season ship leaves","desc_clean":"In the small town of Progrody Nissen Piczenik makes his living as the most respected coral merchant of the region Nissen has never been outside of his town deep in the Russian interior and fantasizes that a Leviathan watches over the coral reefs When the sailor nephew of one of Progrody\u2019s residents comes to visit Nissen loses little time in befriending him for the purpose of learning about the sea The sailor offers Nissen a onceinalifetime opportunity to come to Odessa and tour his ship Nissen leaves his business during the peak coral season and stays in Odessa for three weeks But upon his return to Progrody Nissen finds that a new coral merchant has moved into the neighboring town and his coral is quickly becoming the most sought after As his customers dwindle life takes an evil twist for Nissen Piczenik And the final decider of his fate may be the devil himself","description":"In the small town of Progrody, Nissen Piczenik makes his living as the most respected coral merchant of the region.

Without him I could never have known what it is like to be Indian.\"\u2014Graham Greene  Offering rare insight into the complexities of Indian middle-class society, R. K. Narayan traces life in the fictional town of Malgudi. The Dark Room is a searching look at a difficult marriage and a woman who eventually rebels against the demands of being a good and obedient wife. In Mr. Sampath, a newspaper man tries to keep his paper afloat in the face of social and economic changes sweeping India. Narayan writes of youth and young adulthood in the semiautobiographical Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts.

Small oval windows were set above eye level on the north and south to admit only indirect, soft light and to focus worshippers\u2019 attention inward.Since patrons enter through underground passages, there is no street noise. Nor is there a visible clock, or music\u2014in short, little to distract from meditation. On the lower level one hears chant-like repetitions of prayers softly uttered and the rhythmic dripping of ritual oil and water into small basins as officiators anoint novices. On the middle floors worshippers are presented with allegorical presentations of morality and theology. On the uppermost level, people sit motionless to contemplate God\u2019s plan of salvation. On entering the building, patrons change into plain robes so that for a few hours worldly concerns can be left far behind.  Because non-Mormons are not allowed inside LDS temples, curiosity seekers have tried through a variety of means, especially upon completion of the Salt Lake City edifice in 1893, to ascertain what the interior looks like and what activities transpire therein. This inordinate interest prompted church leaders to commission Professor James E. Talmage in 1911, three months before being ordained an apostle, to compile a visual and textual representation for the general public. Despite an earlier unauthorized foray into the temple by a camera-toting intruder, Talmage\u2019s assignment would represent the first time that good quality views of the interior would be framed and that the ordinances would be discussed in print with the church\u2019s blessing.  In The House of the Lord, more was revealed than anyone had previously thought possible. Members had customarily refrained from speaking about any aspect of their experience there, even to fellow Saints. So through this bold gesture by Elder Talmage and the First Presidency, the cloak of mystery was removed and the temple revealed to the public for what it was\u2014a sanctuary similar to a monastery\u2014or perhaps an ashram or kiva, depending on one\u2019s tradition\u2014where adherents focus undivided attention on attaining spiritual insight.

In the summer of 1943, at the height of World War II, battles were exploding all throughout the Pacific Theater. But none were as deadly, as vicious or as desperately fought as the battle for Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll.  It was the most heavily fortified Japanese territory in the entire Pacific. The Americans wanted it as a staging point for the next big push toward Japan. And one journalist was there to chronicle the horror.

Thirty-one years later, after serving a prison term for an attempted assassination, he was expelled to the Soviet Union, a country which he eventually renounced. But before his repudiation of the Soviet system, Berkman attempted to answer some of the charges made against anarchism and to present its case clearly and intelligently. This book, first published in 1929, is the result of those efforts. Thorough and well stated, The ABC of Anarchism is today widely regarded as a classic declaration of the movement's goals and methods. For those who have questions about anarchism, Berkman provides lucid answers. In conversational tones, he discusses society as it existed in the early twentieth century; why in his opinion, anarchy was necessary; the myths surrounding it; and necessary preparations for its successful implementation. Of the book, Emma Goldman said: \"People need a primer of Anarchism\u2014an ABC, as it were, that would teach them the rudimentary principles of Anarchism and whet their appetites for something more profound.

Sheltered, na\u00efve, and just eighteen, Elsie leaves the stifling environment of her parents\u2019 home in Cornwall to seek out her sister, Leo, who had run away nine years earlier. She finds Leo sharing a houseboat, and a bed, with the beautiful, fair-haired Helen. While Elsie\u2019s arrival seems innocent enough, it is the first of a series of events that will turn Helen and Leo\u2019s contented life inside out. Soon a randy young doctor is chasing after all three women at once, a neighborly friendship begins to show an erotic tinge, and long-quiet ghosts from Leo\u2019s past begin to surface. Before long, no one is sure just who feels what for whom.
