      " and as Pyke intended a ripping yarn  Geoffrey Nathaniel Joseph Pyke  November – February  was an English journalist educationalist and later an inventor whose clever but unorthodox ideas could be difficult to implement In lifestyle and appearance he fitted the common stereotype of a scientistengineerinventor or in British slang a boffin  When World War I broke out Pyke stopped his studies to become a war correspondent He persuaded the editor of the Daily Chronicle to send him to Berlin using the passport obtained from an American sailor and by travelling via Denmark  In Germany he was able to converse with Germans and to see that civilian life there was nothing like as grim as had been portrayed in the British national press He eavesdropped on other peoples conversations and witnessed the mobilisation of Germans for war with Russia – seeing dozens of trains packed with soldiers travelling with seemingly clockwork precision  After just six days in Germany Pyke was arrested in his bedsitting room he was taken away leaving a highly incriminating letter – written in English – on his desk His guards told him Probably youll be shot in the morning He was confined to a small cell convinced that he would soon be executed As time passed Pyke came to believe that he might not be executed after all he rationalised to himself that the German government was not going to waste d on my keep if it was going to be faced with burial expenses on the fifth day  Pyke was kept in solitary confinement He used this time to think Reflecting on his constant hunger – the rations were meagre – he thought   hunger — real hunger — not your going without afternoon tea or noeggsatbreakfast sort of affair — can when a man is utterly without occupation make life one continual aching weary desire If the desire is not satisfied or does not abate of its own accord as it very often does it can have disastrous effects on a mans mind It has been know to make men think very seriously about the rights of property and a few have become so unbalanced as to become socialists   Pyke longed for books writing materials and above all company At the rare exercise times when no talking was allowed he moved briskly round the yard exchanging a few whispered words with the inmates he passed He pieced together poems from memory – If by Rudyard Kipling and Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll – and took to regularly reciting them loudly in the darkness He even asked to see Herr Direktor for permission to whistle occasionally – his request was granted Given his increasingly odd behaviour Pyke wondered whether the guards thought he might be going a little mad and he himself wondered if going mad was the only sane thing to do  After  weeks he was taken to another prison where he was able to mix with other prisoners and buy such luxuries as newspapers More importantly he learned that thousands of foreigners had passed through this prison for a period of quarantine before being transferred to the internment camp at Ruhleben having received no indication of his ultimate fate the thought of being sent to an internment camp cheered him considerably However after just five days he was transferred to his third prison in Moabit Five days later he was taken to the internment camp at Ruhleben  Ruhleben was about  km  mi west of Berlin It had originally been a racecourse and Pyke was given a small bed in the cramped barracks that had been converted from a stable block Here he delighted in the novel sounds of human conversation that he had so missed he listened intently to the inconsequential conversations trifling arguments and even the cursing of his fellow human beings  Pyke soon fell in with a group of fellow graduates from Oxford and Cambridge his new friends supplied him with extra clothes against the winter cold and for the first few days of their new acquaintance with extra food Books and other amusements were shared The internees were allowed to run their own affairs to a substantial degree and they were allowed to make purchases and receive parcels from home There was a thriving blackmarket in permitted but rare luxuries such as soap and forbidden items such as alcohol and English newspapers  Pyke soon became ill he nearly died of double pneumonia and he suffered repeatedly from food poisoning Only as the weather improved with the coming of summer did his health improve Despite illness he constantly thought about the possibility of escape and he repeatedly questioned his fellow inmates Most people he spoke to were pessimistic about escape but eventually he met fellow Englishman Edward Falk who wanted desperately to get out of Germany Others had tried to escape a few had got out of the camp but nobody had succeeded in getting out of Germany Geoffrey began compiling statistical data on these escape attempts so as to find the common failing factors Pyke and Falk reviewed many possible plans and finally made a decision  For weeks before their escape attempt Pyke and Falk followed a regime of calisthenic exercise which they said had been recommended to them by a Danish inmate who was a cardiac specialist In fact the Dane was a product of Pyke’s imagination as were the exercises various crawling wriggles that they would soon put to good use  There was a tiny shed on the exercise ground that was used to store athletic equipment Pyke had noticed that in the late afternoon the sun’s rays flashed through the window blinding with glare anybody who looked inside On the afternoon of  June  Pyke and Falk crept into the hut and hid themselves under tennis nets At the usual time the guard dutifully checked the inside of the hut and even though the prisoners could see him clearly the guard saw nothing amiss They waited until dark and then slipped out and climbed over a succession of perimeter fences  Pyke and Falk camped at a spot near where Pyke had previously observed German troop trains and then took a tram into Berlin They bought clothes and camping equipment and then booked a train westward As they got within  miles  km of the Dutch border they decided it was safest to walk It rained every night and they used up precious time searching for food  As they walked they had to wait patiently at every bridge and railway crossing for the optimum moment to get over they got soaked crossing endless ditches and repeatedly negotiated agricultural barbed wire fences and nearly got swallowed up in the quagmire  Approaching the border they consumed what remained of their food and discarded all their equipment apart from some rope they had made from a ball of string They moved on ready for the final and most difficult stage of their journey – crossing the Dutch frontier Then as they rested they were discovered by a soldier who demanded to know what they were doing Initially they tried to talk their way out of the encounter but it soon transpired that the soldier was Dutch and that they were already  yards  m or so inside Holland  Pyke and Falk made their way from Holland back to England There Pyke went to see his news editor to confess that his mission had failed However his editor was not at all disappointed smiling he told Pyke that the story of his escape based on a long telegraph report Pyke had sent from Amsterdam had been one of the biggest Fleet Street scoops of the war Pyke was the first Englishman to get into Germany and out again and he must write a series of articles for the Chronicle Pyke refused He had by then rather lost interest in being a war correspondent After that he divided his time between lecturing on his experiences and writing an intellectual review the Cambridge Magazine edited by Charles Kay Ogden  Pyke arranged for some food parcels to be sent to friends in Ruhleben the boxes contained details of his method of escape concealed in false bottoms Although his parcels arrived unmolested no prisoner attempted to repeat his methods  As an escaped prisoner of war he was exempt from conscription and in any case his views had begun to drift towards pacifism He wrote a memoir of his experiences entitled To Ruhleben – And Back published in  Because the war was still on at that time Pyke omitted some details of his escape from his account To Ruhleben – And Back was republished in  wikipedia\n",

      "Excerpt from Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition In these lectures an attempt is made not so much to restate familiar facts as to accommodate them to new and supplementary evidence which has been published in America since the outbreak of the war But even without the excuse of recent discovery no apology would be needed for any comparison or contrast of Hebrew tradition with the mythological and legendary beliefs of Babylon and Egypt Hebrew achievements in the sphere of religion and ethics are only thrown into stronger relief when studied against their contemporary background The bulk of our new material is furnished by some early texts written towards the close of the third millennium Bc They incorporate traditions which extend in unbroken outline from their own period into the remote ages of the past and claim to trace the history of man back to his creation They represent the early national traditions of the Sumerian people who preceded the Semites as the ruling race in Babylonia and incidentally they necessitate a revision of current views with regard to the cradle of Babylonian civilization The most remarkable of the new documents is one which relates in poetical narrative an account of the Creation of Antediluvian history and of the Deluge It thus exhibits a close resemblance in structure to the corresponding Hebrew traditions a resemblance that is not shared by the SemiticBabylonian Versions at present known But in matter the Sumerian tradition is more primitive than any of the Semitic versions In spite of the fact that the text appears to have reached us in a magical setting and to some extent in epitomized form this early document enables us to tap the stream of tradition at a point far above any at which approach has hitherto been possible\n",

      "INTRODUCTION   King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table What magic is in the words How they carry us straight to the days of chivalry to the witchcraft of Merlin to the wonderful deeds of Lancelot and Perceval and Galahad to the Quest for the Holy Grail to all that glorious company the flower of men as Tennyson has called the king and his companions Down through the ages the stories have come to us one of the few great romances which like the tales of Homer are as fresh and vivid today as when men first recited them in court and camp and cottage Other great kings and paladins are lost in the dim shadows of longpast centuries but Arthur still reigns in Camelot and his knights still ride forth to seek the Grail  No little thing shall be  The gentle music of the bygone years Long past to us with all their hopes and fears  So wrote the poet William Morris in The Earthly Paradise And surely it is no small debt of gratitude we owe the troubadours and chroniclers and poets who through many centuries have sung of Arthur and his champions each adding to the song the gifts of his own imagination so building from simple folktales one of the most magnificent and moving stories in all literature  This debt perhaps we owe in greatest measure to three men to Chrétien de Troies a Frenchman who in the twelfth century put many of the old Arthurian legends into verse to Sir Thomas Malory who first wrote out most of the stories in English prose and whose book the Morte Darthur was printed by William Caxton the first English printer in  and to Alfred Lord Tennyson who in his series of poems entitled the Idylls of the King retold the legends in new and beautiful guise in the nineteenth century  The history of Arthur is so shrouded in the mists of early England that it is difficult to tell exactly who and what he was There probably was an actual Arthur who lived in the island of Britain in the sixth century but probably he was not a king nor even a prince It seems most likely that he was a chieftain who led his countrymen to victory against the invading English about the year  So proud were his countrymen of his victories that they began to invent imaginary stories of his prowess to add to the fame of their hero just as among all peoples legends soon spring up about the name of a great leader As each man told the feats of Arthur he contributed those details that appealed most to his own fancy and each was apt to think of the hero as a man of his own time dressing and speaking and living as his own kings and princes did with the result that when we come to the twelfth century we find Geoffrey of Monmouth in his History of the Kings of Britain describing Arthur no longer as a halfbarbarous Briton wearing rude armor his arms and legs bare but instead as a most Christian king the flower of mediæval chivalry decked out in all the gorgeous trappings of a knight of the Crusades  As the story of Arthur grew it attracted to itself popular legends of all kinds Its roots were in Britain and the chief threads in its fabric remained BritishCeltic The next most important threads were those that were added by the Celtic chroniclers of Ireland Then stories that were not Celtic at all were woven into the legend some from Germanic sources which the Saxons or the descendants of the Franks may have contributed and others that came from the Orient which may have been brought back from the East by men returning from the Crusades And if it was the Celts who gave us the most of the material for the stories of Arthur it was the French poets who first wrote out the stories and gave them enduring form  It was the Frenchman Chrétien de Troies who lived at the courts of Champagne and of Flanders who put the old legends into verse for the pleasure of the noble lords and ladies that were his patrons He composed six Arthurian poems The first which was written about  or earlier related the story of Tristram The next was called Érec et Énide and told some of the adventures that were later used by Tennyson in his Geraint and Enid The third was Cligès a poem that has little to do with the stories of Arthur and his knights as we have them Next came the Conte de la Charrette or Le Chevalier de la Charrette which set forth the love of Lancelot and Guinevere Then followed Yvain or Le Chevalier au Lion and finally came Perceval or Le Conte du Graal which gives the first account of the Holy Grail\n",

      "Carl Schmitt  the author of such books as Political Theology and The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy both published in English by The MIT Press was one of the leading political and legal theorists of the twentieth century His critical discussions of liberal democratic ideals and institutions continue to arouse controversy but even his opponents concede his uncanny sense for the basic problems of modern politics Political Romanticism is a historical study that like all of Schmitts major works offers a fundamental political critique In it he defends a concept of political action based on notions of good and evil justice and injustice and attacks the political passivity entailed by the romanticization of experience The book has three strands The first is an attack on received notions of the origins of the Romantic Movement Schmitt argues that this movement represents a secularization subjectification and privatization in which God is replaced by the emancipated private individual of the bourgeois social order The second is an assault on political romanticism that includes a broader attack on the new European bourgeoisie which Schmitt characterizes as the historical bearer of the movement The third strand is a defense of political conservatism and a refutation of the view that political romanticism is intrinsically linked with romanticism Here Schmitt argues that the political romantic is tied not to positions but to aesthetics and can therefore as easily become a Danton as a Frederick the Great Guy Oakess introduction places the book in historical context and also suggests its continuing relevance through his discussion of the latest outcropping of political romanticism in the late s intriguingly brought out in his example of Norman Mailer as a political romantic Political Romanticism is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought edited by Thomas McCarthy\n",

      "Arguably her most important and influential book this controversial work first published in  by pioneering birthcontrol advocate Margaret Sanger attempted to broaden the stillradical idea of birth control beyond its socialist and feminist roots Moving away from a singleminded focus on womens reproductive rights to the larger issue of the general health and economic prosperity of the whole human race Sanger argued that birth control was pivotal to a rational approach toward dealing with the threat of overpopulation and its ruinous consequences in poverty and disease Through this book Sanger hoped to persuade the medical establishment to assume control over contraceptive distribution and thereby to lessen the religious legal and moral opposition that continued to restrict access to contraceptive information  However important this book is to the history of womens rights it remains a very problematic work from our more scientifically informed perspective today In arguing for population control Sanger made frequent reference to the then fashionable science of eugenics She also adopted its rhetoric using such callous phrases as the feebleminded and the unfit and advocating birth control as a means of limiting the breeding of defectives delinquents and dependents Although she incorporated views and terminology commonly held in respectable medical and scientific circles of the day Sangers writings on eugenics and this book in particular have become fodder for her critics both on the left and the right who seek to diminish her achievements and obscure what is ultimately a powerful feminist message when women gain greater control over their fertility they will improve the human race  This unusual and historically significant book is complemented by a thoughtful and informative introduction by Peter C Engelman assistant editor of The Margaret Sanger Papers Project who provides much insight by placing this work in the context of the age and Sangers life\n",
