This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel’s plot.  In Chłopi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Chłopi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School",hardcover,616.0,,władysławstanisławreymont europeanliterature polishliterature classics fiction academic school,repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants — autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed chłopi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also ’ author sharply drawn individual portraits,władysławstanisławreymont europeanliterature polishliterature classics fiction academic school repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants — autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed chłopi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also ’ author sharply drawn individual portraits

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that ""something will turn up""; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  ""A wanderer plays on muted strings,"" explains Knut, now six years older, ""when he reaches the age of two score years and ten."" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.

"Write It Right: The Celebrated Cynic's Language Peeves Deciphered, Appraised, and Annotated for 21st-Century Readers",Ambrose Bierce,3.82,151 ratings,6815365,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312026449l/6815365.jpg,"One of America's foremost language experts presents an annotated edition of A mbrose Bierce's classic catalog of correct speech.   Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant ""comport oneself,"" not ""belittle."" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say ""a coating of paint,"" he instructed, not ""a coat.""  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today? From the evidence offered here, it looks like a very good bet.","Nonfiction, Language, Writing, Reference, Humanities, Language",hardcover,240.0,9780802717689.0,ambrosebierce nonfiction language writing reference humanities language,bierces right th anniversary paint devils dictionary time agreed meant rules fabulist write evidence offered mbrose classic catalog round century since instructed language columnist jan freeman best known annotated edition theyve fared lies ahead coat odd pet peeves mark prolific journalist satirist literary faults list includes little blacklist today published several hundred discriminating donate also good measure bet forgotten shibboleths ovation say correct speech ambrose bierce critics distinctions still familiar coating lay one rule less vs fewer lie applause reliable ill formed coinage looks like pretentious jeopardize roman triumph made abounds americas foremost experts presents taboos originated investigated jeopard demean comport oneself quibbles seem usage maven belittle,ambrosebierce nonfiction language writing reference humanities language bierces right th anniversary paint devils dictionary time agreed meant rules fabulist write evidence offered mbrose classic catalog round century since instructed language columnist jan freeman best known annotated edition theyve fared lies ahead coat odd pet peeves mark prolific journalist satirist literary faults list includes little blacklist today published several hundred discriminating donate also good measure bet forgotten shibboleths ovation say correct speech ambrose bierce critics distinctions still familiar coating lay one rule less vs fewer lie applause reliable ill formed coinage looks like pretentious jeopardize roman triumph made abounds americas foremost experts presents taboos originated investigated jeopard demean comport oneself quibbles seem usage maven belittle

First published serially in Gilman’s magazine The Forerunner in 1909–10, the novel tells the story of Diantha Bell, a young woman who leaves her home and her fiancé to start a housecleaning business. A resourceful heroine, Diantha quickly expands her business into an enterprise that includes a maid service, cooked food delivery service, restaurant, and hotel. By assigning a cash value to women’s “invisible” work, providing a means for the well-being and moral uplift of working girls, and releasing middle-class and leisure-class women from the burden of conventional domestic chores, Diantha proves to her family and community the benefits of professionalized housekeeping. In her introduction to the novel, Charlotte J. Rich highlights Gilman’s engagement with such hotly debated Progressive Era issues as the “servant question,” the rise of domestic science, and middle-class efforts to protect and aid the working girl. She illuminates the novel’s connections to Gilman’s other feminist works, including “The Yellow Wall-Paper” and Herland; to her personal life; and to her commitment to women’s social and economic freedom. Rich contends that the novel’s engagement with class and race makes it particularly significant to the newly complex understanding of Gilman that has emerged in recent scholarship.

He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form.
