But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":3.16,"titles":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.

He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today? From the evidence offered here, it looks like a very good bet.","format":"hardcover","genre":"Nonfiction, Language, Writing, Reference, Humanities, Language","id":6815365,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1312026449l\/6815365.jpg","isbn":9780802717689.0,"key_words":"bierces right th anniversary paint devils dictionary time agreed meant rules fabulist write evidence offered mbrose classic catalog round century since instructed language columnist jan freeman best known annotated edition theyve fared lies ahead coat odd pet peeves mark prolific journalist satirist literary faults list includes little blacklist today published several hundred discriminating donate also good measure bet forgotten shibboleths ovation say correct speech ambrose bierce critics distinctions still familiar coating lay one rule less vs fewer lie applause reliable ill formed coinage looks like pretentious jeopardize roman triumph made abounds americas foremost experts presents taboos originated investigated jeopard demean comport oneself quibbles seem usage maven belittle","num_ratings":"151 ratings","page":240.0,"ratings":3.82,"titles":null},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"R.

He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form.

But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats.

Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":1841723,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":3.16,"titles":"Ch\u0142opi"},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"P.G.

Even readers uninterested in cricket are likely to be gripped by descriptions of matches, but the real meat of the book is to be found in the characters, especially the elegant Psmith, one of Wodehouse's immortal creations, who features in three of his later novels.","format":"paperback","genre":"Fiction, Humor, Classics, Humor, Comedy","id":953232,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348073756l\/953232.jpg","isbn":9781421833903.0,"key_words":"find later novels likely characters especially fish real meat found prejudices three entertainment features tale friendship pair eventually overcome old etonian psmith early wodehouse novel p satisfying conclusion wrykyn book gripped descriptions boarding school mike introduced sporting story plot reaches matches water silent wodehouses immortal creations become stars even readers uninterested two boys seriously good cricketer cricket unlikely alliance new sedleigh full forms others elegant one hostility","num_ratings":"2,100 ratings","page":244.0,"ratings":4.04,"titles":"Mike and Psmith (Psmith, #1)"},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"James E.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.  Two years after publication of this \"extract,\" originally planned as a six-chapter book, Twain himself shipped off to follow in Captain Stormfield's wake.","format":"paperback","genre":"Classics, Fiction, Humor, Short Stories, Literature, Fantasy, Literature, American","id":453751,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1365462955l\/453751.jpg","isbn":9781591020240.0,"key_words":"captain stormfields wake last published work universe paradise talk grand scheme discovery produced two years fact cloud strumming reflect view sailors jargon twain recently deceased stormfield earth merchant marine describes reveal next world sitting afterlife seems day turns point insufferably boring outnumber whites plot begun extract originally planned folksy narration peppered six chapter book known really like beginning insignificance eternally youthful also native americans importance things th century outer space feelings told main character huge expanse species north american district twains witty vision actual sea become inadequate humorous new scientific awareness awesome cosmos trouble finding someone confronts us shipped amiable altogether average white anglo saxon male characteristics astronomy outlandish dimensions publication heaven utterly explode every human conception follow insipid teenagers mark harp inspired series amusingly disconcerting revelations finds mixing well pretensions dream crowd traditional religious concepts place funny satirical spoof drawbacks","num_ratings":"569 ratings","page":153.0,"ratings":3.87,"titles":"Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven"},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"Arnold Bennett","bow":"arnoldbennett nonfiction classics writing booksaboutbooks writing essays literature criticism literarycriticism great grandfathers opportunity first years old wives tale theme detailed instructions literary work popular better modern times man essentially pointed rage journalist benefit produced many self improvement books st century probably much good often knowledge collecting still worth complete library study remember widely read ordinary working class people era english literarure came respected authors successful publication way th clayhanger trilogy book britain seem rather quaint generation value started bearing form mind card category appeared heyday free education sought one arnold bennett power taste time sub title famous works included","description":"Arnold Bennett is probably not widely read in the 21st century, but in his heyday during the first 30 years of the 20th century he was one of the most popular and most respected authors in Britain, and his most famous works included The Old Wives' Tale, the Clayhanger Trilogy, and The Card. He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today? From the evidence offered here, it looks like a very good bet.","format":"hardcover","genre":"Nonfiction, Language, Writing, Reference, Humanities, Language","id":6815365,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1312026449l\/6815365.jpg","isbn":9780802717689.0,"key_words":"bierces right th anniversary paint devils dictionary time agreed meant rules fabulist write evidence offered mbrose classic catalog round century since instructed language columnist jan freeman best known annotated edition theyve fared lies ahead coat odd pet peeves mark prolific journalist satirist literary faults list includes little blacklist today published several hundred discriminating donate also good measure bet forgotten shibboleths ovation say correct speech ambrose bierce critics distinctions still familiar coating lay one rule less vs fewer lie applause reliable ill formed coinage looks like pretentious jeopardize roman triumph made abounds americas foremost experts presents taboos originated investigated jeopard demean comport oneself quibbles seem usage maven belittle","num_ratings":"151 ratings","page":240.0,"ratings":3.82,"titles":"Write It Right: The Celebrated Cynic's Language Peeves Deciphered, Appraised, and Annotated for 21st-Century Readers"},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"R.

Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form. His works include: Cabbages and Kings (1904), The Four Million (1906), Heart of the West (1907), The Trimmed Lamp and Other Stories of the Four Million (1907), The Voice of the City: Further Stories of the Four Million (1908), The Gentle Grafter (1908) and Roads of Destiny (1909).","format":"paperback","genre":"Short Stories, Classics, Fiction, Classics, Classic Literature","id":6435452,"img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348172752l\/6435452.jpg","isbn":9781406594324.0,"key_words":"draftsman bank teller known gain international recognition story wrote critics yet took new york city often panned journalist prolific writing period started four million heart roads travelled living stories number different jobs sideline clever use short gentle grafter adored defining publishers next several years first destiny near pharmacist also began employment porters american writer william sydney porter wit wordplay characterization year week went credited trimmed lamp henry austin plot twists works include cabbages moved pen name twist endings world sunday magazine kings voice readers west literary art form","num_ratings":"74 ratings","page":188.0,"ratings":3.99,"titles":"Options"},{"au_ge":null,"authors":"O.

This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.  Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel\u2019s plot.  In Ch\u0142opi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Ch\u0142opi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.","format":"hardcover","genre":"European Literature, Polish Literature, Classics, Fiction, Academic, School","id":"1841723","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1189074060l\/1841723.jpg","isbn":null,"key_words":"repeatable rhythm suggestive picture reality peasants \u2014 autumn published material customs behaviour spiritual culture composition calendar richness doctrines fact authenticity knowledge four parts represents didactic exemplifications write village doctrinal ideas eternal colourful country community believe people tetralogy strict simplicity polish villages plot mentality early th century historical events rather life parallel reader winter spring took place various volumes signal repertoire described sense functionality boundaries reymont placed ch\u0142opi novel astonishes biblical books relationship human division underlines significant influence peasant regulates greek myths complete nature decided created compared impresses writer summer season brought experience religion one vegetational cycle titles also \u2019 author sharply drawn individual portraits","num_ratings":"2,781 ratings","page":616.0,"ratings":"3.16","titles":"Ch\u0142opi"},{"au_ge":"pgwodehouse fiction humor classics humor comedy","authors":"P.G.

The narrator, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is an unsimple character in search of the simple life, which he hopes to attain by wandering round the Norwegian countryside doing such work as he can find. His quest is continually frustrated, not least by his susceptibility to the wives and daughters of successive employers.  In Under the Autumn Star he joins forces first with Grindhusen, a man blessed with the faith that \"something will turn up\"; later with Lars Falkenberg, whose dubious talents include the tuning of pianos. Knut and Lars end up as workmen on the estate of a certain Captain Falkenberg (no relation), with whose wife each falls in love. In due course, Knut is laid off and, in futile pursuit of the woman with whom by now he is helplessly infatuated, eventually finds himself sucked back into the city he once fled.  \"A wanderer plays on muted strings,\" explains Knut, now six years older, \"when he reaches the age of two score years and ten.\" Among this sequel's qualities is the poignancy with which it conveys that sense of aging.

With the help of their mutual friend and doctor, she gets the position as his nurse under a presumed name, and thereby gets to know the 'new' Gareth.","format":"hardcover","genre":"Classics, Romance, Fiction","id":"1420762","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348683580l\/1420762.jpg","isbn":9781432617424.0,"key_words":"known receive mutual friend honorable jane champion go visit rosary know wants loves plain blinded gets receives news help trust doctor presumed name nurse back thereby alas pity position beauty decides great lover love beautiful story gareth dalmain falls new hunting accident","num_ratings":"1,020 ratings","page":380.0,"ratings":"3.98","titles":"The Rosary"},{"au_ge":"williamhopehodgson horror fiction classics adventure pirates fantasy fantasy weirdfiction paranormal ghosts","authors":"William Hope Hodgson","bow":"williamhopehodgson horror fiction classics adventure pirates fantasy fantasy weirdfiction paranormal ghosts incidents suggestive spirits unknown fate powerful account besiege maritime knowledge terrible sea devils command times reaches enviable peaks haunted ship doomed finally drag ghost pirates nature clever selection book last voyage perhaps latent horrors quasi human aspect bygone buccaneers power h p lovecraft hints","description":"\"The Ghost Pirates . . . is a powerful account of a doomed and haunted ship on its last voyage, and of the terrible sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps the spirits of bygone buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to an unknown fate.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.   Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.   This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.

He was essentially a literary man, but he started out as a journalist and in his time he produced many self-improvement books such as were all the rage as more and more ordinary working-class people (having started to benefit from free education) sought the opportunity to better themselves in an era when the theme was often 'knowledge is power\".

Ambrose Bierce is best known for The Devil's Dictionary, but the prolific journalist, satirist, and fabulist was also a usage maven. In 1909, he published several hundred of his pet peeves in Write It Right: A Little Blacklist of Literary Faults.  Bierce's list includes some distinctions still familiar today--the which-that rule, less vs. fewer, lie and lay -- but it also abounds in now-forgotten shibboleths: Ovation, the critics of his time agreed, meant a Roman triumph, not a round of applause. Reliable was an ill-formed coinage, not for the discriminating. Donate was pretentious, jeopardize should be jeopard, demean meant \"comport oneself,\" not \"belittle.\" And Bierce made up a few peeves of his own for good measure. We should say \"a coating of paint,\" he instructed, not \"a coat.\"  To mark the 100th anniversary of Write It Right, language columnist Jan Freeman has investigated where Bierce's rules and taboos originated, how they've fared in the century since the blacklist, and what lies ahead. Will our language quibbles seem as odd in 2109 as Bierce's do today?

First published serially in Gilman\u2019s magazine The Forerunner in 1909\u201310, the novel tells the story of Diantha Bell, a young woman who leaves her home and her fianc\u00e9 to start a housecleaning business. A resourceful heroine, Diantha quickly expands her business into an enterprise that includes a maid service, cooked food delivery service, restaurant, and hotel. By assigning a cash value to women\u2019s \u201cinvisible\u201d work, providing a means for the well-being and moral uplift of working girls, and releasing middle-class and leisure-class women from the burden of conventional domestic chores, Diantha proves to her family and community the benefits of professionalized housekeeping. In her introduction to the novel, Charlotte J. Rich highlights Gilman\u2019s engagement with such hotly debated Progressive Era issues as the \u201cservant question,\u201d the rise of domestic science, and middle-class efforts to protect and aid the working girl. She illuminates the novel\u2019s connections to Gilman\u2019s other feminist works, including \u201cThe Yellow Wall-Paper\u201d and Herland; to her personal life; and to her commitment to women\u2019s social and economic freedom. Rich contends that the novel\u2019s engagement with class and race makes it particularly significant to the newly complex understanding of Gilman that has emerged in recent scholarship.

However, despite the importance of the Quaterman books, many of Haggard's other novels are interesting in their own right. Nada the Lily is the first of four books about the Zulus, all of which are excellent. Eric Brighteyes is rich, fantasy-laden Icelandic saga. The World's Desire (written with Andrew Lang) is a fantasy about the characters in The Odyssey. And there are numerous other titles (many of them reprinted by Wildside Press as part of the Wildside Fantasy Classics series) which bring undeservingly lost Haggard books back into print. The Yellow Idol, originally published in 1908, is another of Haggard's African novels, and it features many elements of the fantastic, such as a magic mask and fetish objects, a lost race, reincarnation, and an immortal woman whose many husbands she has preserved as mummies!

Henry is the pen name of American writer William Sydney Porter (1862-1910). Porter's 400 short stories are known for their wit, wordplay, characterization and the clever use of twist endings. He travelled to Austin in 1884, where he took a number of different jobs over the next several years, first as pharmacist then as a draftsman, bank teller and journalist. He also began writing as a sideline to employment. Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. He wrote 381 short stories while living there. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization and plot twists were adored by his readers, but often panned by the critics. Yet, he went on to gain international recognition and is credited with defining the short story as a literary art form. His works include: Cabbages and Kings (1904), The Four Million (1906), Heart of the West (1907), The Trimmed Lamp and Other Stories of the Four Million (1907), The Voice of the City: Further Stories of the Four Million (1908), The Gentle Grafter (1908) and Roads of Destiny (1909).","format":"paperback","genre":"Short Stories, Classics, Fiction, Classics, Classic Literature","id":"6435452","img":"https:\/\/i.gr-assets.com\/images\/S\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\/books\/1348172752l\/6435452.jpg","isbn":9781406594324.0,"key_words":"draftsman bank teller known gain international recognition story wrote critics yet took new york city often panned journalist prolific writing period started four million heart roads travelled living stories number different jobs sideline clever use short gentle grafter adored defining publishers next several years first destiny near pharmacist also began employment porters american writer william sydney porter wit wordplay characterization year week went credited trimmed lamp henry austin plot twists works include cabbages moved pen name twist endings world sunday magazine kings voice readers west literary art form","num_ratings":"74 ratings","page":188.0,"ratings":"3.99","titles":"Options"},{"au_ge":"ohenry fiction classics youngadult","authors":"O.
